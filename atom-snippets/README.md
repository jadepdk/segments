# Atom Snippets #

This includes a custom snippets library for the Segments system.  To install:

- Locate your Atom Editor's snippets file. On Mac OSX High Sierra, this is located at `~/.atom/snippets.cson`.

- You can either just replace the file with the included Segments `snippets.cson`, or if you already have modified the file with some of your own snippets, then you can copy and paste the contents of the included Segments `snippets.cson` into the Atom Editor `snippets.cson` file on your machine.
